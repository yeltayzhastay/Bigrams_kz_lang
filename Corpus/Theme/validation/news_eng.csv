O. Shamelkhan, a resident of Bayan-Ulgii region, has been voluntarily delivering garbage from the city to garbage collection centers in Ulan Bator since 2018. This was reported by the local agency MONTSAME. I have been working as a driver for about 40 years. Currently I am loading on the Bayan-Ulgii-Ulanbatyr route. I mainly transport various goods from Ulan Bator to Bayan-Ulgii. Since last year, I have been transporting recyclable waste from the streets of Ulgii, garbage containers , plastic bottles, plastic door and window makers to Ulan Bator. In two years I took about 40 tons of garbage. This is, firstly, a contribution to the ecological cleanliness of our city, and secondly, there is not always a load from Bayan-Ulgii to Ulan Bator. That's why I load this garbage and take it to the garbage collection points. This is one way to cover the cost of travel, says the elderly driver. According to him, garbage is not bought from anyone. Some people bring their own. Most of the time, Shamelkhan collects garbage from the streets and landfills. Although the weight of the garbage is light, it takes up a lot of space and little space for cars. With this in mind, the driver says that if there is a local garbage bag and baler, it is possible to load more than 15 tons of garbage in one go. Environmentalists have long proven that salofan bags and plastic bottles, which are widely used in everyday life, cause great harm to the environment. It is said that it takes more than 1,000 years for a single plastic bottle to be disposed of in a landfill and become a natural fertilizer.

Vice Minister of Education and Science Sholpan Karinova said that the requirements for state educational grants will be strengthened. He made this statement at today 's meeting on the results of the international PIAAC program. The results of today's research clearly show the need to change the quality of higher education. This should be aimed at improving the functional literacy of schoolchildren and students. This year, more than 56 thousand grants were allocated, and only 1.2 people competed for one place in the course. That is, any candidate could apply for a grant, - said Sholpan Karinova in response to a question from reporters. According to the Vice Minister, this will have a negative impact on the quality of education. Of course, grants should be provided. However, if we reduce the number of grants, we must increase the value of the grant. Direct funding is provided only through these grants. Today it is not enough. The increase in the material and technical base of higher education institutions and the salaries of faculty members do not meet these parameters. Therefore, increasing the cost of the grant will improve the situation in the university, - he concluded. According to him, due to competition for grants, we will increase the quality of education. In general, since 2018 we have been working to develop the academic independence of higher education institutions. This step will significantly increase the rate of higher education, - explained Sholpan Karinova. The Vice Minister also stressed the need to improve the quality of education for students . Right now, I can not say for sure that we will reduce the number of grants. There is no need to reduce the number of grants. Our goal is to improve the quality of education provided to students. Work is underway. A special analytical group is engaged. The price of a state grant must be commensurate with the quality of education. We analyze and monitor. Then we will announce the exact results, - said the Vice Minister of Education and Science.

JSC "Passenger Transportation" has terminated the contract with a company that has been providing bedding for trains for many years . However, the new company that replaced it is turning the carrier to the ground. As a result, JSC "Passenger Transportation" from November 1 to 20 will return the excess money to passengers for failure to provide them with standard blankets . This was announced on the official website of the company. Interestingly, this could have been prevented. However, according to businessman Askar Omarov , "Passenger transportation" instead of saving, on the contrary, incurs significant costs. "As-Ai", which supplies bedding to passenger trains, won the tender five years ago. However, "Passenger Transport" does not want to bring it closer. LLP "As-Ai", which lost its profits, repeatedly sued the transport company and won in all. There are court decisions. The uncollected profit is paid by the respondent. However, As-Ai claims that there are shortcomings on the part of Passenger Transport. Today, the operator of three bedding companies pays one company. The company failed to meet its obligations on time. This was announced on the official website. And we are recovering the loss of the court decision. So, "Passenger transport" is twice lost, - says Askar Omarov. According to the businessman, this gap has been going on for several years. We are the legal winner of the tender. However, the transportation company gives priority to others. The railway industry, which is already suffering losses, is paying more and more. All this is due to the fact that the management is not working properly. In this situation, he even appointed a German citizen to head the Passenger Transportation Company. Let's evaluate the back of the alphabet. However, I will write a letter to President Tokayev and President of JSC "NC" Kazakhstan Temir Zholy "Mynbayev. Such arrogance should be avoided, - said Askar Omarov.

What kind of weather is expected in the coming winter? Writer-ethnographer Bolat Bopayevich , based on the ancient methods of forecasting the Kazakh people, told what the weather will be like next winter. Қалай How did the Kazakh people predict the weather in ancient times? People who predicted natural phenomena early were called "astrologers" or "accountants" . Kazakh accountants will have a notebook with a notebook on one side and a black cover on the other. When someone asked for the weather, he would open the ledger and predict the weather. Kazakh accountants rely on many things to monitor natural phenomena . The stars looked at the direction of the sky, at what time, and in what form, looking at the rising and setting of the sun, the rising and setting of the moon, and predicting weather changes based on the shape of Afghan clouds, running beasts, and livestock . There are 24 operations, 13 intersections, 7 signs, 4 seasons in 12 months. Kazakh accountants paid special attention to 24 operations. One operation takes exactly 7 days. There is the entry of the action, the middle of the action, the exit of the action. If the beginning of the process is hard, then it will be happy. And there is a notion that if you enter slowly, the end will be hard. In winter there were snowstorms and heavy snowfalls, and in summer there were mudslides and white rains. Accountants used to calculate such accidents in advance. Each year also has its own character . − What is the forecast for the coming winter? - This year, July in the Year of the Pig was very hot. It rotates in 270 days and arrives in February. For example, summer July is from June 26 to August 5, and winter July is from December 27 to February 6 . According to the experience of former accountants, if July of this year is very hot, in February of next year there will be frost. It was very hot in July this year, but there was no precipitation in summer. In winter, it can be very cold and very cold. Although it will snow in early winter, there may be less snow in February. If it rains a lot in northern, southern and eastern Kazakhstan, it will snow a lot. And if it was very hot, it was very cold. There is a star on the threshold of the sky . In autumn, the winter is shorter if the two stars are closer together. And if it is far, respectively, the winter will be longer. Next year is the year of the mouse. We expect that this winter of the year of the mouse will not be easy. Interviewer: Dinara Dospan

Of course, we did not give up the technical staff, because they have to do the general cleaning. To be honest, one parent was against it - she said she wouldn't let her daughter clean up. We answered that we will not force anyone - everything will be voluntary. This initiative was supported by all parents. There are 1,906 children in our school, ”the school principal said.“ We hope that other schools in Kazakhstan will learn from this experience. ”In Japan, children clean themselves - it's a culture.
